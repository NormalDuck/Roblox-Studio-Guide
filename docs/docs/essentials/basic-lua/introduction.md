## Prerequisite
- A compiler/website to test your code. Preferably [one compiler](https://onecompiler.com/lua) for the sake of simplicity. Or you could install lua manually inside your machine which isn't something we offer in this section.
- Knowing [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) very well. Knows how to at least use custom blocks, lists, and scratch variables. We don't recommend learning this tutorial unless you have a sturdy idea of what coding is.
