## Why I chose Roblox
At first I chose Roblox because I wanted free robux, just like every other kid. Roblox’s scripting takes 3 or so months to understand, which is really quick compared to other game engines. Put lua in comparison to python, it will just be slightly harder. You all might be watching those videos that complain that Roblox makes a 80%, some say 90% cut of developer’s revenue. But Roblox provides free database hosting, free server hosting, free uploading files. Maintaining those yourself will actually cost alot of money. Although free stuff comes with consequences like bad servers or whatever. But creating on Roblox is actually free, beginners friendly, and low budget or even no budget. Roblox is perfect for solo developers, but also theres room for professional developers.
